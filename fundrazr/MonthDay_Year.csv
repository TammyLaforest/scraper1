  to my parentsÂ  Simone Green and Sammy Ferguson. I weighed 7lbs, 4.6
  ozs at birth.Â I look like any other healthy baby girl,Â  but the
  doctors say I have fluid around my brain. This isn't good because if it's not treated I could end up with brain
  damage or even die. I have been living in the NICU since birth. I
  can't go home to be with my parents because I need a MRI. The cost of
  the MRI is $2,000 at Doctors Hospital. Sadly, my family is unable to
  come up with the funds needed at this time.Â  I'm asking you to help
  us, so that the doctor's can fully access my condition and I can
  finally go home and start living. Please donate to my cause and share my request with your family,
  friends,Â  coworkers,Â  church groupsÂ  and even strangers.Â  We all need
  a little help sometime. If you are unable to donate please pray for my family to raise the
  funds needed in time, and pray that I get better withoutÂ  needing
  additional medical treatment. Thanks in advance, Baby Zillah P.S.

Father of 3 and a grandpa to an amazing little 3-year-old girl named
  aniah who is my everything. I am starting this campaign in the hopes of raising funds to get the
  surgery that I so desperately need to live a normal life again. I was diagnosed with subcapsular cataracts in both eyes that is
  taking away my vision and in my case, my vision is deteriorating
  pretty quick. this particular cataract can mature in years months or
  even weeks. It seems that some of the asthma medications I have been taking for
  years ADVAIR to help me breath contained steroids thatÂ years later
  would change my way of life in a way that I would have never imagined.
  you know your in deep trouble when you can't see your own face in the
  mirror anymore. At 52 I was just enjoying my 3-year-old grandbaby and watching her
  grow up and looking forward to seeing her attend the 1st day of school
  and school plays and just being her protector and best friend. without
  this surgery, I will not see her grow up and do those little things
  that mean so much. This surgery is very expensive 3500 per eye and I don't have the cash
  or the insurance to cover this surgery on my own so the only way I can
  restore my vision and have a normal life again is to ask for help.
  your small donation can help me get closer to getting the surgery I need. My situation is urgent that's why I am reaching out to family and
  friends to donate. my ability to focus is gone already. all I see is
  shapes bright light and lots of fog and it's so scary. I don't leave
  the house anymore the sun makes it worst and my hobbies of producing
  music and gaming are sadly over for me at this point. I can't read
  anything unless its a few inches in front of me and only out my right
  eye. my left eye no matter how close I can't read out of it.
  depression has also kicked in but trying to stay strong. the only
  relief I get is when I close my eyes to sleep. if I can get only one
  eye done I would be the happiest person in the world but the goal here
  is to get both done. I hope that you can find it in your heart to donate to my campaign so
  I can see faces vivid colors and blue skies again. most importantly I
  would be able to see my granddaughters face again. thank you god bless
  you all and have a great new year. John Eric Mendez",https://fundrazr.com/Gift4Sight150,Giving the Gift of Color,U.S. Dollar,,of $349 goal,3,"Hoping to help give the gift of color to my kiddo. Every penny

      good friend, Claudia and I, had just moved her mountain Boutique
      to a new location and it needed a new fresh look. She brought in
      Ray, probably the gentlest and sweetest soul, to do the job.
      ""You pick it, I paint it"" he would say each day he came
      in. What I didn't know was that he wasn't just using a catchy
      slogan.Â  Over the week he spent with us I came to find our Ray is
      color blind and has been for the 76 years he has been on this
      wonderful world. Ray never had an opinion on the colors or chose
      them himself because he could not see the shades as we did. As I watched him carefully tape off the corners and windows
      and gentle apply the mint green and merlot red to our walls I
      realized that Ray would never be able to see how truly beautiful
      his work was. In between stories of his rowdy youth and extra
      coats of paint on the walls it dawned on me that Claudia and I
      could do something special for Ray to help say thank you for all
      his work.... EnChroma Glasses! So, I went online and started
    harassing all my friends and neighbors. SURELY! SOMEONE had to have
    a pair of those fancy glasses we could borrow. In my search a
    community member mentioned that there must be many more in our
    community that could benefit. The decision to start a fund for a
    permanent publicly available pair was made. All we needed to do was
    find a home where people could access them. Luckily, we didn't have
    to look far. Neighbor to the Boutique is Wild Bear Nature Center,
    Boulder County's only all ages, non-profit nature center. WILD BEAR NATURE CENTER Wild Bear Nature Center sees about
    27,000 visitors through its door every year. With a passion for
    re-connecting all ages with Nature as well as educating the
    importance of taking care of this beautiful earth, we believe that
    this is the home for our Enchroma glasses. THE PERFECT HOME.
    Utilizing Wild Bears ability to direct people to nature hikes, snow
    shoeing or one of their superb programs, we can create exceptionally
    magical mountain moments for Color Deficient seers that will last a
    life time. Imagine the oranges and reds of the Aspens to an eight
    year old who has never seen those shades before. Or imagine seeing
    the deep hues of our back country for the very first time for
    someone who has spent their whole lives in the Rockies. All the funds collected will be
      used to purchase a pair of EnChroma glasses that will be available
      for any one with Color Deficiency to rent free of charge. Any
      remaining funds will be used to make an exhibit for the center
      explaining Color Deficiency and Blindness as well as educating
      visitors how other animals see color. And of course we will have a
      special night with Ray, the reason this all started. Thank you for spending the time to
    read our story. We greatly appreciate any and all donations. WHAT IS ENCHROMA? Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color
  vision deficiency, also called color blindness. Enchroma has created
  glasses which enhance color vision without the compromise of color
  accuracy. Enchroma glasses are an optical assistive device; they are not
      a cure for color blindness. Results vary depending on the type and
      extent of color vision deficiency per individual. The glasses are
      estimated to be effective for 4 out of 5 cases (80%) of red-green
      color vision deficiency â€“ prospective users are encouraged to take
      our online color vision test to assess the likelihood of efficacy. Enchroma does not
      endorse use of the glasses to pass occupational screening tests
      such as the Ishihara test. For more information please read the FAQs , learn about the Enchroma technology and story , or contact customer support .

  infertility struggles. Together since high school, this fall marks 13
  years together, and in April we will be celebrating 6 years of
  marriage. While many known to us have lovingly asked when we plan to
  have children of our own, only those closest to us are aware of the
  painful experiences and heart wrenching losses having suffered four
  miscarriages, in which 2 were ectopic pregnancies. The first
  miscarriage unexpectedly occurred in 2008. Later in 2010, my wife
  discovered she was pregnant again, but days later experienced extreme
  pain. At the hospital, doctors discovered that her left tube had
  ruptured as a result of the embryo attaching to the tube which ended
  up needing to be removed. After coming to terms that pregnancy may be
  difficult with only one tube, she suffered another miscarriage in
  2013.Â  We were disheartened, but we didnâ€™t lose hope even though her
  chances were less than the average. Unfortunately, in 2016 we found
  out we were pregnant again and the doctors closely monitored pains
  sheÂ  began experiencing yet again. It turned out to be another ectopic
  pregnancy and the doctor had to remove her right tube.Â  The result of
  both her fallopian tubes needing to be removed makes fertilization
  impossible to happen naturally. We were devastated to discover the loss of another
  baby, especially after hearing that we can no longer have children. In-Vitro Fertilization is a medical procedure that can help
  make it possible to start a family. Adoption has crossed our mind,
  however the process can cost more and take just as long, if not
  longer. The medical costs of the previous miscarriages,
  testing, and diagnoses have already been painful and difficult
  financially. We have looked at all options and learned how IVF may be
  able to help us with our situation. We now hope to make a trip to
  Florida this summer in June, to a fertility clinic that offers an IVF
  package that fits our needs. We have already taken steps to
  communicate with the friendly and helpful staff and are hoping to move
  forward with any pre-testing needed to be done as soon as possible.
  Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that an IVF cycle will be
  successful the first time, but this fertility clinic will allow us a
  chance at 6 IVF cycles. Generally, a single cycle of IVF ranges
  between $9,000 - $11,000 with medication that can add an additional
  $5,000 - $8,000. Sadly, IVF is not covered by insurance so these
  expenses will be out-of-pocket.Â  The money raised would be used to
  cover any medical testing, the IVF procedure, medication, airfare, and
  lodging. The success rates of IVF for my wifeâ€™s age range (29) is at
  its peak, and if we wait too long to attempt this procedure, success
  rates drop dramatically with age. The medical cost and conditions of IVF are compounded
  by the lack of access to facilities and care on island which have
  brought us both to a place that we had hoped we would not have to find
  ourselves asking for -asking for help from others. We both come from
  very tight-knit families, and we are grateful that they continue to
  support us by guiding us towards finding ways of making our dreams of
  starting our own family possible. My wife and I are working on saving what we can, but as
  you can see, the procedure is quite pricey. I am currently working two
  jobs to help make ends meet, and my wife is just short away from
  graduating with a degree in English Literature on top of full-time job
  as well. She has plans to become a teacher once everything falls in to place. Everyone has a different path, and for us things just
  come a bit later in life, but weâ€™re continuing to work hard in
  reaching our goals. Any and all donations are greatly appreciated, and
  we thank you for taking the time to read our story. We understand that
  we all have struggles of our own, so even your prayers will be greatly
  appreciated during this time. Thank You and God Bless, Darrell & Caitlyn Pangelinan",https://fundrazr.com/darrellandcaityivf705,Boitano Support Club - Liz Kicks Cancers A$$,U.S. Dollar,11-Mar-19,of $4k goal,14,"Liz, Joe, and beautiful babe Ryan, have had a crazy past couple of
  months. What started out as exciting news of an addition to their
  family, turned into a molar pregnancy taking that joy
  away. After processing the loss, and surgery to remove the mass,
  Liz had her levels monitored regularly to make sure everything was on track. In mid January, Liz's levels started rising, so she was brought in
  last week for an ultrasound and chest X-ray. These confirmed that a
  mass had returned and she was scheduled for surgery the following
  Tuesday. In the meantime, a CT was ordered. Tuesday came and the CT
  showed that the tumor was malignant and had metastasized to her lungs.
  Surgery was no longer an option. Yesterday, February 7th, the doctor
  called and said they didn't want to wait to start treatment. A PICC
  line was placed and inpatient chemo started today. Her port will be
  placed on Tuesday. This has been a very fast and very intense ride for Liz and her
  family. Another outpatient surgery turned into a minimum of four
  months of chemotherapy; they will need a lot of support from family
  and friends. I'm asking all who know Liz, Joe and Ryan, those who don't but
  understand the long battle ahead, or those who simply have a giving
  spirit and the monetary ability, to donate whatever amount you can. Unplanned childcare costs, lost wages, deductibles, etc. will be
  building very quickly. For those who don't know her, Liz is one of the most incredible
  humans on this Earth. She is one of far too many facing this
  undeserved disease. Prayers, positive thoughts, well wishes, and

  where we both used to work. We met because I needed help with a UA
  calendar problem - I couldn't get my events to save and it was
  important b/c I was in a marketing position at the time. She found the
  glitch and helped me out of a pickle. We've been friends ever since. Now, she needs help, and it's of a more serious nature. Shelley has
  been at Banner University Medical Center since the beginning of
  November, 2018, in the ICU. She nearly died an untimely death in her
  40's. She is a mother to a lovely daughter, who recently graduated
  college, & Shelley herself got married over a year ago to a
  wonderful man named Marcus Coltrin. Shelley has been diagnosed with
  idiopathic autoimmune necrotizing myositis. She is unable to speak
  with her actual voice right now, as she has had a tracheotomy and
  communicates using a laminated sheet displaying the alphabet and
  points to the letters in order to spell words. She will have to learn
  to do many things all over again - things that we take for granted.
  Her care in the ICU for about two months costs more than Blue

  to share my story over the past year and a half. In the year 2017,
  happiness came to our family, I got married, my sister got married
  too, then my wife and I had a son. My sister and her husband moved to
  the United Kingdom for permanent residence. It would seem that everything was fine, everything was getting
  better, a new step in a new life, something completely new, and how
  grate was to give a new life. But in November 2017, the misfortune
  came to our family, two cancerous tumors in the head were found at my
  mother, and a completely different story began. It was decided to excise the tumors surgically. The date of the
  operation was set. Analyses, radiological examination and fluorography
  before the operation, revealed a spot in a lung. The additional
  analyses detected a cancerous tumor in the left lung. The commission of doctors decided to conduct an operation on the
  head, and after that to remove completely the left lung, and take a
  histological analysis. Within one month both operations were
  successfully performed. Histological analysis showed the nidus of cancer in the lung. Next,
  we had to conduct PET - CT (positron emission tomography), this is a
  computer tomography for detecting tumors in the whole body. And it was
  also necessary to complete 5 courses of chemotherapy. The decision was to conduct all the examinations at the Neolife
  Oncological Clinic in Istanbul (Turkey). In January 2018, we went to
  the clinic. We took the analyses, underwent examination and PET
  scanning. The result was disappointing. A stain was found above a kidney and in a bone, and a small tumor in
  the head. The commission of doctors prescribed six courses of
  chemotherapy, injections against bone destruction, and a course of
  radiotherapy. Every three months, an MRI scanning of the head was conducted. At the end of chemotherapy courses, again in Istanbul a PET scan was
  made. All the chemotherapy courses were purchased at the Neolife
  Clinic, and were dripped in Chisinau at the Oncological Clinic. On the 27 of February, 2018, my dad fell down and broke his leg in
  the femoral neck area, an urgent operation was performed, 3 screws for
  bone fusion were installed, the healing time was on average from 4 to
  8 months. Here begins a new stage, but we will not go deeply into it
  and move directly to June 2018. We finished the course of chemotherapy with my mom and the regular
  examination of the leg with my dad. We decided to fly first to
  Istanbul, and then, upon arrival, to examine the father. On the arrival in Istanbul, another PET scanning was made, the results of which were
  quite consolatory. The stain over the kidney disappeared, one remained only in the bone,
  but we continued to drip the injections, which was against the
  destruction of bones. The commission of doctors proposed 4 courses of
  sustaining chemotherapy to fix the results and the next examination at
  the end of the courses. It was like a light at the end of the tunnel. Was that really the end
  of that difficult period of life? We purchased chemotherapy courses
  and went to Chisinau with good news. Upon the arrival we went for an examination with dad, underwent a
  radiological examination. Radiological examination showed that there
  was no coalescence of the femoral neck, and it is necessary to put a
  femoral prosthesis, in 2 months after the installing the prosthesis,
  one can safely walk and live a full life. After choosing the prosthesis and the surgeon to conduct the
  operation, the day of the operation was appointed. The operation was
  successful. In general, everything began to get better, the difficult
  period of life slowly began to move away from us. After the finishing of the courses of supporting chemotherapy, on
  04.11.2018, my mother and I went to Istanbul for another examination,
  full of confidence and hope that everything would be fine. On
  05.11.2018 mom underwent another PET scanning which again made us unhappy. The result showed that another tumor appeared in the head next to the
  place where the last two were removed, a tumor appeared again above
  the kidney and the spot on the bone increased, in the lymph nodes
  where there was the left lung, small trace of possible metastasis was
  found. It was like a blow. Now we have done another analysis for pathology to select the next
  chemotherapy courses, and we are also waiting for the results of a
  consultation of doctors who must decide whether it is possible to
  apply radio emission to remove the tumor from the head. We have gained
  strength and are trying to overcome this disease. With all my heart I want to thank all the relatives, friends and
  those who did not remain indifferent to our situation, for their
  support, for their moral and material assistance. Now we are in a difficult situation, because all our accumulated
  funds have long ended, all that was possible to sell is already sold,
  all where it was possible to lend out is already borrowed and the
  terms of debt recovery are coming around, and now we have no means to
  continue treatment and to return the debts. Debts, which are totaled
  in the amount of $ 39000. And the preliminary sum for the continuation
  of the treatment has not designated yet. For this reason, I indicate

  I ask to help all who can. I have always been of the opinion that $
  5-10 for many people is not a significant sum, but can help someone to
  save lives. Whenever it was possible, on some fundraising portals, I
  always tried to help people. I sent it and immediately forgot it, but
  I was sure that for the person to whom I sent money it was definitely
  more necessary. Now I am in that situation that I myself need

  several years ago and the fear that gripped me about my future at the
  time was overwhelming.I am so grateful to have found help in many ways
  to regain all of my health and feel younger and stronger than I have
  in over ten years. It was simply because I was lucky that I stumbled
  across the natural health solutions that led me out of my own private despair. So, my friend and fellow Social Entrepreneur with Evolv Health, Judy
  Adolf,Â  and I have been talking for some time about using the model of
  social giving to help individuals in our community who are overwhelmed
  with a health challenge. It is through no fault of their own they have
  been buried under financial strain which only compounds their health
  issues. We decided to help people with their health in general by
  creating a Wellness focussed community MEET UP GROUP called
  ""PURPOSEFUL WELLNESS which fulfills a mandate to inspire and
  educate others about nutrition, fitness and natural healing methods
  that can help. But we also added a unique component modelling our own
  Evolv Social Business and created a fundraising platform that could
  greatly impact someone suffering with an illness or disability. Many
  face these challenges quite unexpectedly and the financial strain is
  often beyond their ability to cope. So for the first 3 months ofÂ  ""Purposeful Wellness"" we
  decided to help our mutual friend Blu Mankuma who is a well loved
  actor/ entertainer in our community currently on Kidney dialysis who
  can no longer work at his profession. He is a kind and loving soul and
  we thought who better than Blu to be our first recipient in the
  charitable program we have implemented. Our goal initially was to raise 2,000. to contribute to his meagre
  income from pensions and disability and since the campaign was so
  successful we have decided to keep going for another 2 months as we
  can see this has brought him such relief and he has a long ways to
  go.. This would to take some of the strain off him so he can buy
  healthy food , pay his rent and perhaps regain some strength through
  an immune support product that he could otherwise never afford. Blu Mankuma's Health Story- ""I'm an actor/director, singer/songwriter and producer.
    When I was in college I began noticing a little swelling around my
    ankles and when I went to the doctor and after several tests, he
    gave me salt pills and told me to keep him apprised. But he had no
    answers and for years the swelling continued. No matter how many
    tests the doctors did, they still had no answers. A few years ago I
    was having dinner, when I felt the need to throw up. On route to the
    bathroom, I lost my balance, I fell and was unable to get up which
    surprised the heck out of me!! I felt like the lady in the
    commercial who says,""help! I've fallen and I can't get up""
    That episode led me to the ICU at VGH for a while and then I was put
    on dialysis which I now do 3 times a week for 4 1/2 sessions. I'm
    unable to do much film work and find it hard to get by on pension
    and disability funds and it has been a struggle just to pay rent. However, I remain positive that one day my kidneys will return to full
    function but until then, I continue to fight the good fight! I'm

  dinner when we received a voicemail from Jamesâ€™ doctor. She said to call immediately and left her personal cell phone
    number. As we walked, James was being his usual self:
  running down Southport Ave and acting like a healthy, happy little
  boy. Forty-eight hours later, James would be inÂ critical
  condition,Â on aÂ ventilator, andÂ fighting for his life.Â Â Two days after
  that James was diagnosed with an extremely rare form of Leukemia. When we called the doctor back, she shared that a routine blood test
  showed Jamesâ€™ white blood cell count was abnormally high and she
  wanted us to get more tests done by the Leukemia and cancer
  specialists at Lurieâ€™s Children Hospital. To put it in
  perspective, healthy children usually have a white blood cell count of
  5,000 to 10,000. Jamesâ€™ was at 32,000. Thursday was the soonest appointment we could get with a hematologist
  - a doctor who specializes in diseases of the blood. The
  doctors at Lurieâ€™s confirmed that something was not right. They wanted to get a bone marrow sample to figure out what was
  going on and the quickest way to the front of the line was to have
  James admitted. At that point, there wasnâ€™t a high level
  of concern for Jamesâ€™ immediate health. We spent the day
  playing with trucks, reading books, watching â€œgeeâ€ù (Curious George)
  andÂ looking at cars, trucks, buses and all his favorite sights of the
  city from the hospital room window. On Friday morning at 9:30 am, James underwent a procedure to extract
  a bone marrow and a bone sample from his hip. The
  doctorâ€™s shared what they were testing for: James likely either had
  Leukemia or an auto-immune disease. Devastation. A few hours later the oncologist (cancer doctor) called us to the
  consultation room for a discussion. She shared what was
  seemingly good news. The initial blood results had ruled
  out the most common types of Leukemia, which typically make up more
  than 99% of annual childhood Leukemia diagnosis. The
  only cancer they couldnâ€™t rule out was a very rare form of Leukemia
  called Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, or JMML. We
  would later learn that JMML is so rare that there are currently only
  20 kids diagnosed in the U.S. While we didnâ€™t yet have an answer for what was affecting James, we
  cautiously celebrated the news since the other options were an auto
  immune disease or pneumonia.Â  We were told the rest of the tests would
  likely come back on Monday. That night Jamesâ€™ health rapidly deteriorated. His
  temperature spiked to 104. His heart rate was racing at
  200 beats per minute. His lungs began to fail. To help his little body the nurses and doctors put him on
  oxygen and a few IVs. While we were scared â€“ and not
  knowing what was happening â€“ we at least had the benefit of being able
  to talk to the doctors. James didnâ€™t. As the night progressed, the doctorâ€™s wanted to increase his oxygen
  to help with his lungs; and to do so, he needed to be moved to the
  Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and only they could administer
  the higher dosage. For the next 24-hours, JamesÂ would not rest; his body would not let
    him. Each time he did fall asleep, he would wake up 10
  to 20 minutes later terrified and not knowing what was happening.Â  His
  body was in overdrive, IVs and sensors all over his body, a tube
  inserted down his nose into his stomach â€“ how could he understand? It was excruciating. His body was being
    overworked. He was having trouble breathing. He was not getting the rest needed. He was
  pleading with all the words he had.Â  â€œAll done.â€ù â€œMomma.â€ùÂ â€œUp.â€ù
  â€œOutside.â€ù It was heartbreakingÂ and terrifyingÂ to watch
  our poor little baby so scared and so sick, feelingÂ completelyÂ helpless. The PICU team told us what we could already see. Â Jamesâ€™ body
  could not sustainÂ this paceÂ on his own, so we made the decision to
  sedate and intubate him (put on a breathing machine.) It
  was mentally impossibleÂ to hear but we knew it hadÂ to be done.Â Â We sat
  bedside with James as he was sedated and the breathing tubes inserted
  into his lungs.Â  This was two days after we walked into theÂ hospital
  with a seemingly healthy little boy. Saturday brought a new bombshell. The only piece of
  good news we had received instantly disappeared. Our
  James had JMML, the rarest type of childhood Leukemia. The doctors now suspected that James did not have pneumonia. Instead it was leukemiaÂ filling his little lungs with white
  blood cells. Jamesâ€™ white blood cell count accelerated
  rapidly throughout the day from 30,000 (which we previously thought
  was unimaginably high) to 50,000 to 78,000 to 90,000 to 111,000 to 128,000. Our little James was now in critical condition. Some of
  the best doctors in Chicago were working with him minute-by-minute,
  hour-by-hour to keep him going. Everything had happened
  so fast that we didnâ€™t even have time to process one bit of news
  before we had moved onto another. But we kept in mind
  one thing: if youâ€™ve met James, you know he is aÂ strong-willed little
    toddler. If anyone canÂ battleÂ this, itâ€™s James. While Jamesâ€™Â lungs were responding to the breathing machine, it
  wasnâ€™t enough.Â  The doctors decided to move him to a
  newÂ ventilatorÂ that could also administer anesthesiaÂ gasÂ in addition
  toÂ breathing for James.Â  This machine had to be brought up from the
  E.R. and had only been used a few times on the PICU floor over the
  past two years. We were told James may be the sickest
  patient in the hospital (438 patients) and that he was fighting for
  his life. We were grasping for straws. The doctors told us they
  were running out of things to try. We
  discussedÂ unprovenÂ options that had never been tried on a patient as
  young as James. We signed consent forms. Fortunately, the new machineÂ began to stabilize James and we took
  some of those options off the table.Â  During â€œroundsâ€ù the next
  morningÂ we countedÂ thirteenÂ doctors and nursesÂ around Jamesâ€™ room to
  getÂ an update on his condition.Â  We felt like we were in the right
  place with the right level of attention from an incredibly experienced
  medical staff. We had tremendous support from family and
  friendsÂ â€“ all rallying around James and supporting us day and night. On Sunday, August 12th- just 5 days after receiving that urgent
  call from the doctor - James started Chemo. His chemo is
  now administered twice a day. Once for
    30-minutes. Later in the day for 4-hours. He typically also requires a blood transfusion. This is in addition to the 18-25 drips of medication he is on
  every hour. As crazy as it sounds, this is only part of the story over the past
  week. There have been other challenges with blood
  pressure, his lungs filling with carbon dioxide (CO2), scary
  challenges switching him to new medical machinery, but tough little
  James is making progress. On Wednesday the 15thÂ he moved
  to a smaller ventilator. His white blood cells are down
  to 30,000. While still on anesthesia, James has been resting in bed with his
  night time puppy, Curious George stuffed animal and aÂ pacifierÂ in one
  hand and his favorite toy truck in the other. We have
  been reading James books, which is very difficult while keeping your
  emotions in check. James has a long fight in front of him. Itâ€™s scary to
  think about all the challenges ahead but right now we are focusedÂ on
  today. One step at a time, then we will tackle the next target. Ultimately, the only cure for JMML is a bone marrow transplant, in
  addition to extensive chemotherapy over the coming months until we
  find the appropriate donor match. If you want to see if
  you would be a match for James, please register at the website below. Nearly 5,000 kids will be diagnosed with Leukemia this year. There are a lot of kids like James out there whose only hope is
  to find a good donor match. You can do it from your own

      help her recover her full health. We are Water Docs and our mission is to evoke a
      spirit of reverence for water; to inform about threats that
      imperil water; to inspire citizen action to protect water. We
      believe that water ripples deeply in each of us and to stir that
      rippling is to awaken action. We also believe we are fully aligned
      with Grandmother Josephine and her mission. Since we are all connected to the water, we strive to follow
      the teachings and example of Anishinaabe Elder and Grandmother
      Josephine Mandamin, Ogichidaa Kwe of Wiikwemkoong Unceded
        Territory and of the Midewiwin Way of Life. Josephine has
        unselfishly petitioned for the healing and restoration of Nibi
        (water) for many years and as such, she has come to be known as
        The Water Walker. Leading by example these past many years,
        Josephine has walked around and blessed each of The Great Lakes
        and many other bodies of water. She has inspired the creation of
        and galvanized a network of Sacred Water Walkers and Water
        Protectors across Turtle Island (North America) and has
        encouraged all women and men to take up this work for the
        healing of Nibi and our great Mother Earth. Josephine is far too humble to
      ever ask for help but contributing to her barrier to wellness is an unresolved issue arising
      from her past work through OI Leasing and Native Leasing Services. Former employees of OI Leasing
      were straddled with suffocating tax debt from years of service
      working for First Nations people off reserve. Revenue Canada (CRA)
      took these people to court for uncollected income tax and lost,
      but had the ruling overturned and began aggressively
      pursuingÂ First Nations defendants for back taxes, interest and
      accrued penalties. More background information on
      this case can be found here. Since June 2018, some work has
      been done to relieve former employees of tax interest and
      penalties. If she is successfully reassessed, her current $59,000
      claimed debt may revert back to the original tax amount of
      $32,000. In the meantime, we are hoping to raise enough money to
      assist JosephineÂ to relieve her of this unfair financial burden.
      So far, through the effort of one of Josephine's spiritual sons,
      almost $10,000 has been raised toward this cause. The situation has become a
      cause of stress for Grandmother Josephine and her family and, we
      believe, an impediment to her full rest and the recovery of her
      health and well-being, and her peace of mind. The CRA has threatened her and
      has been garnishing her hard-earned pension, which has affected
      her ability to meet household expenses. She lives on very humble
      means, while still travelling here and there when able, always
      continuing to work for the People and for the Water. She has unselfishly dedicated
      years of her life to others from her work for the Ontario Native
      Women's Association; her work as an Elder when she was raised up
      in the Lodge; to her calling as a Water Walker and birthing of the
      Sacred Water Walks. She has inspired us to answer the call of the
      Water and take meaningful and dedicated action on behalf of Nibi.
      She is truly a respected Grandmother of the great Anishinabek Nation. After all these years of
      devoted public service, to gether we can end this
      outstanding issue for Josephine and her family once and for
      all.Â Collectively, we can certainly give back to her in this very
      tangible and meaningful way. Please consider donating any
      amount you can to help pull Nookomis out from this ordeal and back
      onto the path toward good health and happiness. Help us make the season of
      giving a wonderful way to show our gratitude, love and

  teacher in London, having gone on a holiday to Brazil last summer.
  During one of our many visits to the beach in Rio De Janeiro, Rafael,
  my 6 year old son made friends with a little Brazilian girl called
  Laura, and since then we've got to know her family. So over the last
  few months, I've been learning about the sad story of Laura's little
  brother, Bernardo who is 2 and a half. He is currently just out of
  hospital as a result of a condition called hydrocephalus. This
  basically means he has an accumulation of spinal fluid on the brain
  which has caused a very real threat to his health. Since I met his
  family, he's been in and out of intensive care and had been in
  hospital for months now. Fortunately, with the help of Crowdfunding,
  his family was able to just about scrape together enough to pay for an
  operation a short while ago to remove the build up of fluid on his
  brain by installing a valve. Before that Bernardo was at risk of
  cardiac arrest.Â  Tragically, after that, he suffered an aneurism, and
  his family are now deep in debt having to pay for the surgery which
  saved his life after this, after which he was in coma for some time. Just before Christmas, they were able to get Bernardo out of
  hospital, where he had been every night for about 3 months (aged only 2). For those who haven't been to Brazil, it is very much the haves and
  the have nots and the have nots don't have even the healthcare they
  need to, in some cases, survive. They of course have no NHS in the
  same way as we do. Since I've known Bernardo's mum, she has lost her
  home, evicted because of paying all her money to the hospital for the
  last operation to keep Bernardo alive. Sadly, this also means that
  Bernardo has not been given the wheelchair he needs to support his
  damaged spine. Without this, he cannot sit up properly, meaning that
  he needs to be constantly on the lap of an adult. He is aged 2 and a
  half, and if he cannot get the wheelchair soon, it will cause more
  damage to his spine. Below I've copied an appeal from his mum, copied through Google Translate Hello everyone my name is Andreza. Some people here helped me
      already. I have been facing serious difficulties with my son
      Bernardo who was born with hydrocephalus. With the help of some
      friends and relatives of David I was able to perform his surgery. But as I had mentioned the fight did not stop there ..
      unfortunately Bernardo does not walk yet and does not speak,
      because of his illness .. So I would like to ask you again for
      help so that we can reach another obstacle and win! Today Bernardo needs a wheelchair. It will be of great help to
      him, outside the fatigue that where we go we have to carry him in
      my lap everywhere. He does not fit inside the buggy, so we have
      great difficulties His doctors asked us to use a special one for him to
      strengthen his spine so that in the future he could wear boots and walk. So I came here humbly to ask again for help from friends,
      colleagues and family members who can help us achieve this goal! From now on I thank those who can help and those who can not.
      I hope God blesses your life! As you can see from the pictures and videos, Bernardo can not
    sit up at all on his own. This means that for every waking minute he
    is either bed ridden, or has to be held up. The wheelchair is a
    special one which has straps to hold his back up. The doctors said
    that this can help to correct his spine. His mum is concerned at the
    moment that his back is causing him a lot of pain, he is suffering a
    lot and the doctors have said that the wheelchair will help this.
    Here is the model https://cirurgicapassos.com.br/carrinho-star-baby-vermelho-9487-assento-30cm-cadeira-de-rodas-baxmann-jagu.html Since the last campaign I did for Bernardo, his family have had

    costly, life saving surgery and now his family have a huge debt pay
    off, and they really have no way of buying this wheelchair that he
    needs urgently. He will need ongoing physical therapy throughout his

  Polycythemia Vera, which is in an advanced stage. At this time, she uses a very small, shared bathroom, sharing
  with five household members (her husband and kids) and guests, which
  contains only a shower, sink and toilet. Candi becomes very
  lightheaded, has fallen several times, and her immune system is badly
  compromised, making sharing a bathroom highly dangerous. Also, she
  suffers from extreme full body pain, and a lot of days, she is unable
  to move around without assistance. Having a tub she can relax in,
  and a bathroom which can be kept exclusively her own and sanitized
  daily, would go a long way in helping her fight against the cancer,
  and will give her a calm and safe place to recover and relax after
  treatments. She was donated a tub but unfortunately the one
  bathroom they have is very tiny. Much too small for any size of a tub. We (her husband, friends and other family members) are hoping to
  be able to build on a master bathroom, no frills, for her to use.
  Permits and building materials are needed. It won't be a huge bathroom
  and we will be doing our best to find the cheapest, though safest for
  her, materials possible. We will also be doing the work
    ourselves to save money. We are hoping to keep the cost under $2500, and if more is

  emotional stress, and burden from society and my family. I moved out to be independent in May 2014. Â Since then more drama had
  developed. Â Adding to the financial pain. All my appointments, tests,

  atresia. The main procedure that was performed is known as a Kasai
  portoenterostomy. This operation connects the bile drainage from the
  liver directly to the intestinal tract. Success of this procedure may
  be improved when it is done before an infant is 8 weeks old. The Kasai
  procedure is helpful because it permits bile to flow and can allow a
  child to grow and remain in fairly good health for many years. It is
  important to understand that this surgery is typically a treatment for
  and not cure of biliary atresia. Ongoing liver disease is likely to
  continue to occur even with a successful operation. Up to 80 percent
  of children who undergo the Kasai portoenterostomy will eventually
  need to have a liver transplant. Doctors warned that Zach would not
  live past the age of 2 years old. Now at 30Â years old, Zach has
  surprised the medical community. He has gone through quite rough times
  in his life growing up with this disease. His mother passed away in
  2006 from liver and kidney failure due to alcoholism. Zach cannot work
  a ""normal"" job anymore due to complications that arise from
  this disease. He is currently in the process of fighting for
  disability. The application status is pending. We are asking to share

  wife who is suffering from devastating medical issues while being
  incarcerated in a dangerous menâ€™s prison. My wife Lani is a
  trans woman who is currently incarcerated in Trousdale Turner
  Correctional Center ( a private CCA facility). In 2015 Lani entered Rutherford County Jail where she was immediately
  put in solitary confinement because she is transgender. Within 2 weeks
  and while in solitary, a night guard came in while she was sleepingâ€_
  put a pillow over her head, raped her and told her if she said
  anything he would make sure she was dead. She made her first attempt
  at suicide soon after the attack. The same officer went into her cell a second time in the middle of
  the night while she was sleepingâ€_ he held her down and raped her
  again. She stayed silent out of fear for her life. In 2016 she was moved to a Bledsoe State Prison. During that time she
  saw a doctor for a routine medical exam. Lani told the doctor that she
  had been raped twice by an officer at which point she was given STI
  tests. The medical officer did NOT report Laniâ€™s sexual assaults. Her
  STI results came back negative. In Aug. 2016 she was shipped to Hardeman Correctional Center where
  she faced continuous vicious sexual assaults. During the five months
  of her stay at Hardeman, an officer would open her cell door to let
  the inmates inside. Lani prepared a written complaint to a PREA coordinator in the
  compound. The coordinator did not order a rape kit, instead, the
  facility responded by transferring her Trousdale Turner, the worst
  private prison in Tennessee. When Lany arrived at Trousdale, she told the medical officers she was
  raped and wanted to be tested for HIV. They tested her and found she
  was now HIV positive. Since she has been diagnosed, the medical staff
  have continuously missed many of her HIV medications, as well as her
  hormone blockers and mental health meds. She is being denied adequate
  access to both HIV and transitional medical care. I fear for Laniâ€™s health and her life- the fear never leaves me. I am
  reaching out for help because the facility recently stopped giving HIV
  patients the vital nutritional support drinks that are needed to
  ensure their health. The prison also does not provide any form of
  undergarments for the trans women. Most of my funds are spent on daily
  phone calls to make sure that Lani is safe. The funds donated
  here will go towards food and clothing packages to make sure Lani has
  what she needs for day to day survival until she can be transferred to
  a safe facility where she can receive the medical care that she needs. Lani LOVES Pen-Pals. If you would like to reach out to her and send
  her support, please write to: ""Lani"" James Gibson #563634 c/o TTCC 140 Macon Way Hartsville, TN 37074 Please note, If you are a lawyer or can help with legal advise
  regarding Lani's situation it is more than welcome. FAQ about Lani Question: Why are we currently not taking legal action against Core
  Civic in regards to her being sexually assaulted and negligent medical care? Answer: We are currently trying to get Lani moved to a TDOC facility.
  Core Civic has retaliated against her before and have threatened to
  transfer her to another one of their facilities, farther from home and
  they have stated she will be placed in segregation for the rest of her
  sentence (approx. 3 more years.) That would be a death sentence for Lani. Question: Can I make a JPAY account and donate to Lani that way? Answer: Yes, Lani's legal name is James Gibson and her TDOC# is 563634. Question: How can I make sure that donated funds go directly to Lani? Answer: Lani receives receipts for all the funds that are placed in
  her JPAY account. Just let us know if you would like one and we will
  happily mail it to you. Anything other questions, please feel free to ask.",https://fundrazr.com/41SOyf"1,770",Vivre Pleinement avec Philip,Canadian Dollar,1-May-19,of $25k goal,19,"Bienvenue a notre campagne de financement FundRazr Nous avons besoin de vous afin dâ€™aider Philip Ã  vivre

    diagnostiquÃ© dâ€™un cancer de l'hypopharynx de stade 3. MalgrÃ© la
    nouvelle, Philip garde la tÃªte haute et les yeux pleins dâ€™espoir; il
    est prÃªt Ã  se battre. Pour ce type de cancer, les spÃ©cialistes
    estiment une durÃ©e de vie de 8 mois ainsi quâ€™un taux de rÃ©ussite des
    traitements de chimiothÃ©rapie de 30%. Pour combattre la maladie,
    Philip a entamÃ© ses traitements de chimiothÃ©rapie. Le type de
    traitement quâ€™il reÃ§oit se fait par intraveineuse et la durÃ©e des
    traitements est de 12 heures par sÃ©ance, toutes les deux semaines.
    Une fois une sÃ©ance terminÃ©e, celui-ci doit immÃ©diatement se
    retrouver en quarantaine dans un endroit aseptisÃ© durant les 7 jours
    suivant le traitement. Suite Ã  lâ€™Ã©tat difficile dans lequel les effets secondaires du
    traitement le laissaient, Philip a finalement pris la dÃ©cision
    dâ€™arrÃªter ses traitements, afin de profiter au maximum du prÃ©cieux
    temps quâ€™il lui reste plutÃ´t que de vivre alitÃ© et semi-conscient. Ayant perdu son travail dÃ» au temps quâ€™il devait accorder Ã  ses
    traitements et Ã  son isolation, Philip doit toutefois continuer de
    manger et de payer son loyer et une inquiÃ©tude monÃ©taire sâ€™installe.
    Il est crucial pour la santÃ© mentale de Philip de garder son
    indÃ©pendance, de rester autonome et dâ€™avoir une vie active le plus
    longtemps possible. Une santÃ© mentale forte est donc extrÃªmement
    importante afin quâ€™il puisse garder la tÃªte haute. Positif, fonceur,
    travaillant, combatif et attentionnÃ©, Philip a besoin de votre aide
    afin de conserver son autonomie, mais aussi pour garder espoir. Les Fonds Les fonds que nous souhaitons recueillir pour aider Philip
    permettront de couvrir tous les besoins de base pour une pÃ©riode de
    12 mois: Loyer, hydro, nourriture, mÃ©dicaments, dÃ©placements,

    vie active le plus longtemps possible, Philip a besoin dâ€™amasser
    25,000$ afin de couvrir tous les frais et dÃ©penses qui seront
    nÃ©cessaires au courant de lâ€™annÃ©e 2019. Une fois les frais de base

  and the other called Spinal Muscular Atrophy, which works to rob her
  of her ability to move, breath and, eventually, live. There is a drug
  that can stop this disease. It has just approved it. But accessing it
  costs $177,000, and the process of our drug plan wonâ€™t be ready for
  another year. Thatâ€™s a year that our little girl canâ€™t afford to wait.
  It would be a year of vulnerability and loss. But with your
  help, we believe we can turn it into a year of miracles! Let me
  tell you the rest of our story. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) has
  become our daily life. Itâ€™s the genetic condition most likely to kill
  children under six years of age, and our daughter has it. Itâ€™s a
  progressive lower motor neuron disease, that is loosely paralleled to
  adult ALS. But there are significant differences: most notably, SMA
  never affects cognition, so our daughter is as bright and keen as any
  other child her age. At 14 months, Hannah took her first 3 steps. She has never walked
  since then. After those first steps, she lost any strength to walk,
  then strength to pull up to stand, and then the strength to crawl. She
  can barely get from a lying position to a sitting position. Hannah is
  our mature little scholar! But she is completely dependant on us for
  dressing, toileting, and getting her in her wheelchair.But those
  things arenâ€™t the worst. She is at an extreme risk of respiratory
  failure. Every single simple cold/viral infection is a threat. At
  least three times a year these infections strike hard enough to send
  her to the hospital. As a parent, I weep and get nauseous just
  thinking about this. I donâ€™t want to think about what the next year
  could hold for her. But the amazing thing is that it doesnâ€™t have
  to be that kind of year for our little girl. For over two decades
  the gene responsible for SMA has been known but there has not been a
  single available treatment. This past summer the first drug in history
  to specifically treat SMA was approved ! It is called Spinraza
  (Nusinersen). It can completely halt SMA in its path and even lead to
  some GAIN in muscle strength! This drug truly is a miracle, and
  we need our daughter on it as soon as possible. Though itâ€™s
  approved Spinraza wonâ€™t be available on our drug plans for another
  year. It costs $177,000 to provide a yearâ€™s supply for Hannah 3 vials
  . The manufacturer, Biogen, will sell it directly to families willing
  to pay for it. This treatment WILL stop Hannah's respiratory deterioration, keep her
  hands strong, and prevent future problems in her spine that would
  require surgery.And we donâ€™t even know what gains it might provide.
  Instead of a year of atrophy it can become a year of miracles! But we
  need your help. We do everything we can for our little girl but we
  canâ€™t do this alone. We need to raise $177,000. Please join us

    local site, which then sends the samples back to our lab in the U.S.
    to reduce the costs of shipping. If you live in Australia or Singapore and would like to
    participate, claim a perk.Â  The next page will have an option to
    ""top off"" your contribution with an additional amount,
    which you will use to add in the $25 to mark your kit to go out. I f you do not include the $25 shipping fee, your kit will not be
      sent out until we have received it. Once we have received your transaction, we will forward your
    information to our collaborators. They will then send out a kit to
    you, which you will receive within 3 weeks . Please note that the r eturn time for results will take significantly longer than the
    expected 3 months for Australian/Asian Gut participants. The reason
    is that we have to bulk ship samples on dry ice back to our lab at
    UC San Diego. Â This costs thousands of dollars per shipment, so itâ€™s
    only feasible to do once enough samples are ready to ship. If You Live Anywhere
    Else: International participants are also
    welcome to join. The $25 international shipping fee also applies (which you must include in your contribution), along with other regulations . I f you do not include the $25 shipping fee, your kit will not
      be sent out until we have received it. We also ask that samples are shipped back to our lab within 48 hours of being collected. The cost of shipping to our lab in the U.S. from some
    locations can be expensive , so it is recommended that you look into the cost of return
    shipping (it is highly suggested to use FedEx as it is more
    reliable). If you are interested in learning the process of our project
    from start to finish, we have a video available here . Each kit contains a sample tube (or more, if ordered), an
    instruction manual on how to register your kit and take a sample,
    credentials to access our participant website, and return
    envelope(s) to send your sample back. Your results will provide a general overview of how your microbial profile
    compares to other participants ( these results are not intended to be medically actionable,
      and we cannot provide any personalized interpretation ). You will also receive a list of the microorganisms found in
    your sample and their relative abundances (based at the genus
    level). Â Results are uploaded via our participant website, which you
    will get access to once you register your kit. For stool samples, it will take about 3 months for you to receive your results, and longer for those who are
      participating outside the U.S. (due to shipping procedures to send
      samples back to our lab, which is based at the University of
      California San Diego). Â It takes approximately 4-5 months to
      receive results if you submit one of the following sample types: Oral or skin samples . A desktop computer or laptop is recommended to register and log your sample into our
      participant portal website, as our participant website has
      compatibility issues on mobile devices and tablets. Â The best
      browser to use when you register your kit is Google Chrome . Note that your de-identified information will be part of a
      research study and will be made available in a publicly available
      research database. That is, any personal information that might
      easily identify who you are will be removed before being placed in
      the public database. If you decide that you no longer wish to continue in this
      study, please send a request to the American Gut Project help
      account ( info@americangut.org ) to inform us of your intent to withdraw. You may request a
      refund within 50 days of your original payment if you have not yet used your kit. Please note that the Fundrazr transaction fee will be
        deducted from your refund. The consent forms are maintained on the participant website;
      details are included in your kit. To sign the consent form, you
      must agree to use an electronic format for your signature in

  Zimbabwe. While in Zimbabwe, i was touched by my mum (Ellen) and my
  aunt Trina's work, they helped so many people with the little they My
  mum'shouse was like a medical response centre, people in the village
  would come seeking basic pain killers and food. The situation in
  Zimbabwe has made it difficult for health centers to treat it's
  citizens, if your loved one is admitted in hospital they still need to
  bring in their own medication because hospital are struggling to
  supply. Because of these conditions people are dying from illnesses
  could be easily prevented. The Zimbabwe health system is struggling
  and i understood why my mother tried to help where she could. Ellen's
  Hope Trust is a medical response charity started in honour of my
  mother in October 2018 and we are already overwhelmed with
  applications for medical attention. At the moment we are desperate to help two great young people Mary
  and Miguel have limbs. Mary was involved in a road accident when she
  was 5 years oldÂ she's now 10 years old and doing very well in her
  class and dreams of becoming a medical doctor one day. Mary also needs
  an operation to remove a protruding bone at the back of her leg and
  her eyesight is deteriorating, which will need to be seen by a specialist. Miguel is twelveÂ  years old, very energetic and intelligent young
  man. He is a prefect in his class and dreams of being a pilot one day.
  Miguel loves playing football but unfortunately he really struggles to
  play with other boys and getting a limb will be a dream come true for him. Miguel was born disabled and lives with his grand mother he will also
  need to see a specialist as his knees have been traumatised from
  kneeling on rough surface. Ellen's Hope Trust Charity mission is to avail medical and surgical
  Interventions to the less privileged regardless ofÂ  gender, race or
  creed. The trust is a non profit organisation run by ordinary citizens
  with noÂ political and religious affiliation. We are asking you to be part of our vision. We have a quotation for prosthetic limbs for both Mary and Miguel of

  Youth Association's Sports Day. For those of you who don't know Hank & Jeannie Tate they have
  been sacrificial servants and loving on others the entire 44 years of
  marriage. They have been amazing servants and blessing to the
  homeschool community since they started homeschooling in 1984. They founded the Tomball Homeschool Support Group Hank co-founded the South East Texas Homeschool Association
    regional organization and served as President as they served over
    120 Support Groups. Hank co-founded the Gulf Coast Home School Conference and
    co-managed it for over 20 years. Over 2,000 people were blessed each year Hank taught the Beginner Homeschool 5 class series in Houston
    and around the U.S. for over 20 years. Over 350 workshops for over
    25,000 homeschoolers. Hank served on the Boards of HOPE for Texas, and the Texas
    Homeschool Coalition over 10 years. Hank and Jeannie have also served, and still serve, on the
    Board of the Homeschool Christian Youth Association (HCYA) over 20 years They have managed HCYA Graduation over 20 years. Hank is still
    managing Graduation. They have managed HCYA Sports Day over 15 years. Though their
    management ended with Jeannie's stroke two years ago, they still are
    serving as volunteers for Sports Day Hank and Jeannie haven't just loved on other homeschoolers, for
  over 20 years they have been passionate about loving anyone,
  especially those that are broken and hurting. They have a GOD FAMILY
  of over 70 people that have been ""added-on"" to their family
  as God Daughters, God Sons, and God Grandkids. Their GOD FAMILY
  includes 11 nationalities, and two survivors of human trafficking that
  came through SAMARITANS TOUCHÂ  ( http://samaritanstouch.com ) a
  ministry to survivors of human trafficking that Hank and Jeannie
  started in 2008. In December Hank had oral surgery that triggered Shingles. He has
  been in constant pain since then, but he biggest impact is that the
  shingles has had on him is that it has destroyed 50-70% of his
  hearing. When Hank was 5, he lost the hearing in his right ear to
  mumps, so heâ€™s already deaf in that ear and losing his hearing in the
  other ear has been devastating. Obviously, Hank needs a hearing aid!
  The cost of the hearing aid is substantial and their insurance wonâ€™t
  cover it. The $5,500 target is sufficient to cover the needed hearing aid, and
  an additional oral surgery he needs. Any additional support will go to
  pain therapy, lost wages, and cover the costs of buying a new cell
  phone. The hearing aids won't work with an Android phone, so Hank will
  need to pay off his current phone and buy a new iPhone. They are also
  hoping to get away for some refreshing and renewal time. Ever since
  Jeannie's stroke two years ago, stress overwhelms her and Hank's
  Shingles has definitely overwhelmed her. *Any money donated will go
  directly into Hank's PayPal account. Hank & Jeannie Tate have blessed the lives of homeschoolers in
  incredible ways, even thousands that have never met them. I have
  watched them bless others for many years. Please consider blessing
  them back.",https://fundrazr.com/hankshearingaids"664,612",British Gut,,,,,"This is a unique open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The American Gut Project (AGP) / The Microsetta Initiative to expand the study of the bacterial diversity to
    participants in Europe. If you are a participant living outside Europe and would like
    to participate, please refer to our American Gut Fundrazr page . Many
  people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play an
  incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them:
  They make up 50 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"". Â Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe, as an extension
    of the American Gut Project & The Microsetta Initiative, based
    at the University of California San Diego. Â We have collaborated
    with TwinsUK at Kingâ€™s College London so that those living in Europe
    can participate, and with your help, we will be able to discover
    more about the crucial relationship between our health and our
    microbiome, and on a personal level, you will be able to discover
    the bacterial profile of your own gut. With your help, we hope to be
    able to answer questions such as 'How much does our choice of
    lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and can we alter our
    microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has
    their own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out
    what constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of
    bacteria are beneficial and which ones should be avoided. In order
    to do this ambitious and much-needed project, we urgently need a
    large scale collection of human samples. Over ten thousand people
    have already signed up in America already through the American Gut
    Project-- but we need many more from Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main
    'microbial home', however, the study will also look at areas like
    the oral and skin, as these areas of the body may be influenced by
    the microbiome. Joining is simple! Select the kit you would like from the list
    of options on the left-hand side by clicking â€œClaim this perkâ€ù found
    on the right side (if you would like to receive a specific number of
    kits that isnâ€™t listed as a perk, email us at info@britishgut.org ). You will receive your kit within 3 weeks after payment. Shipping within the U.K. first class should be around Â£2.90, but
    we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the proper
    postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is important
    since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely not
    produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your
    sample to us, we will then be sent to the Knight Lab at the
    University of California San Diego to be processed and analyzed. We estimate that the whole process will take about 4-5
  months. We typically bulk ship samples back to the Knight
  Lab every 1-2 months on dry ice to reduce shipping costs. Once your
  sample is arrives at the Knight Lab (you'll get a notification when
  they have received your sample), it takes approximately 3 months to
  return results. Each kit contains a sample collection device (or multiple if you
    ordered more than one), an instruction packet on how to sample, and
    return envelope(s) to send your sample tube(s) back. Once we provide you with your results, you will receive data
    visualization of how your results compare to other people who are
    within the same diet and lifestyle group as you (having different
    results from them does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can
    just be that you have different lifestyles that make bacterial
    profile is different). Â Â In addition, you will be provided with a
    list of the major groups of bacteria in your sample and their
    relative abundances (based at the genus level). These results are not actionable,
      and we do not provide any personalized interpretation . It will take longer than the expected 4-5 months to receive
      results if you are submitting one of the following sample types: Oral or skin samples. A desktop computer or laptop is recommended to register and log your sample into our
